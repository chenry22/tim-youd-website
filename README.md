This is a website I built for artist Tim Youd for his streaming event "Up All Night"!

The website is designed to provide some basic information about the event and store a collection of interviews which were conducted for the event itself!

The watcher.py script is used by a Github Action to handle new interview uploads and update these changes on the live site. Since Spotify podcast episode links are not available until the episode is public, this was the easiest way to manage these updates automatically.
